* Quality metrics
** Supervised machine learning problems
*** Classification
**** The classifier as a decision rule
A decision rule $\pi(a | x)$ generates a *decision* $a \in [m]$. It is
the conditional probability of $a$ given $x$.
#+BEAMER: \pause
**** Deterministic predictions given a model $P(y|x)$
Here, we pick the most likely class:
\[
\pi(a | x_t) = \ind{a= \argmax_y P(y|x_t)}
\]
#+BEAMER: \pause
**** Randomised predictions given a model $P(y|x)$
Here, we randomly select a class according to our model:
\[
\pi(a | x_t) = P(y_t = a  | x_t)
\]


*** Accuracy as a classification metric
#+BEAMER: \pause
**** The accuracy of a single decision
\[
U(a_t, y_t) = \ind{a_t = y_t}
 = \begin{cases}
1, & \textrm{if $a_t = y_t$}\\
0, & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
#+BEAMER: \pause
**** The accuracy on a dataset
Let $D = \{(x_t, y_t) : t \in [T]\}$ be a dataset. We can measure the accuracy:
\[
U(\pi, D) \defn \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \pi(y_t | x_t)
\]

**** The expected accuracy of a decision rule
#+BEAMER: \pause
If $(x, y) \sim P$, the accuracy $U$ of a stochastic decision rule $\pi$
under the distribution $P$ is the probability it predicts correctly
\[
U(\pi, P) \defn \int_\CX  dP(x) \sum_{y=1}^m P(y|x) \pi(y | x)
\]
*** Beyond classification: Generalised decision rules
Consider a spam application, where the e-mail client can decide between different action for emails.
Different actions being best for each type of e-mail. The quality of each action can be captured through a utility function.
**** Utility of the spam decision problem                    :B_exampleblock:
	 :PROPERTIES:
	 :BEAMER_env: exampleblock
	 :END:
What utility function would you use for the spam detection problem?
|----------+------+------+-------|
| Utility  | Pass | Flag | Trash |
|----------+------+------+-------|
| Normal   |      |      |       |
| Spam     |      |      |       |
| Virus    |      |      |       |
|----------+------+------+-------|
**** The utility function $U : \CY \times \CA \to \Reals$
The utility function $U(y, a)$ is a real-valued function so that, for a label $y$, we prefer taking action $a$ to $a'$ iff $U(y, a) > U(y, a')$.

*** The optimal decision
- A *model* $P(y | x)$ of class probabilities
- A *utility* $U(y, a)$ for each class and action combination
#+BEAMER: \pause
**** Expected utility
We can calculate the expected utility of any decision
\[
\E[U | a, x] = \sum_y P(y | x, a) U(y, a) = \sum_y P(y | x) U(y, a)
\]
Here the first equality follows from the definition of conditional expectation and 
$P(y | x, a) = P(y | x)$ as the label does not depend on our actions.
#+BEAMER: \pause
**** The optimal decision
For any observation $x$, and $P$, we take the action maximising expected utility:
\[
a^* = \argmax_a \E_P[U | a, x] 
\]
This defines a function $\CX \to \CA$, which is the Bayes-optimal decision rule.

*** The optimal decision rule
- A *model* $P(y | x)$ of class probabilities
- A *utility* $U(y, a)$ for each class and action combination
- A *decision rule* $\pi(a | x)$ assigning probability to action $a$ for every possible input $x$

#+BEAMER: \pause
**** Expected utility over a dataset.
We obtain the expected utility of the *decision rule* by marginalising over all actions
\[
U(\pi, D) \defn \E[U | \pi, D]
\overset{D = (x_t, y_t)_{t=1}^T}{=}
\sum_{t=1}^T \E[U | \pi, x_t]
= 
\sum_{t=1}^T \sum_{a \in \CA} U(y_t, a)\pi(a | x_t)
\]
Here the first equality follows from the definition of conditional expectation and 
$P(y | x, a) = P(y | x)$ as the label does not depend on our actions.
#+BEAMER: \pause

**** Expected utility over $P$
We can marginalise over possible datasets $D$
\[
U(\pi, P) \defn 
\E^\pi_P[U]
= \int_{\mathcal{D}} \!\!dP(D) U(\pi, D)
\overset{\textrm{i.i.d.}}{=} \!\! \int_{\CX} dP(x) \sum_{\CY} P(y | x) \sum_a \pi(a|x) U(y,a)
\]



*** Taking into account the probability
- For classification, it makes sense to look at the probability of the labels.
- If we are not very confident about our prediction, this should be taken into account:
- Define $P(y | x)$ to be our classifier's probability for label $y$, given features $x$. Then we can use two simple metrics:
*** Precision
The average probability of the actual class:
\[
\sum_{t=1}^T P(y_t | x_t) / T
\]
- If we always assign probability 1 to the correct label, this score is 1. 
- If we always assign probability $1/m$ to all labels, the score is $1/m$.
*** Negative Log-Loss
Here we assign look at the *logarithm* of the probability. This really penalises bad guesses.
\[
\sum_{t=1}^T \ln P(y_t | x_t) / T
\]
- If we always assign probability 1 to the correct label, this score is 0.
- If we assign probability 0 to even a single label, the score is $-\infty$.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from sklearn.metrics import log_loss
#+END_SRC
in scikitlearn implements log-loss (*not* negative)
*** Regression

**** The regressor as a deterministic decision rule
A decision rule $\pi$ generates a *decision* $a \in \Reals^m$.
- For *deterministic* rules $\pi(x)$ is the prediction for $x$.
- Since we can almost never guess correctly, we need to define the quality of our predictions somehow, either as a utility $U(y_t, a_t)$ or a loss function $\ell(y_t, a_t)$.

**** Mean-Squared Error Loss on a Dataset
This is the squared difference in predicted versus actual values:
\[
\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T [y_t - \pi(x_t)]^2  
\]

**** Expected MSE
If $(x, y) \sim P$, the expected MSE of a deterministic decision rule $\pi : \CX \to \Reals$ is
\[
\int_\CX \int_\CY dP(x,y) [y - \pi(x)]^2.
\]
*** Probabilistic regression
**** The regressor as a stochastic decision rule
A decision rule $\pi$ generates a *decision* $a \in \Reals^m$.
- For *stochastic* rules $\pi(a | x)$ defines a density over predictions.
- In this case it is natural to define $\pi(y_t, x_t)$ as our metric.
**** Likelihood on a Dataset
The mean-square error is simply the squared difference in predicted versus actual values:
\[
\prod{t=1}^T \pi(y_t | x_t)
\]

We will later see a link between this metric, mean-square error and estimation.


* Generalisation
*** Training and overfitting
**** Training data
- $D = ((x_t, y_t) : t = 1, \ldots, T)$.
- $x_t \in \CX$, $y_t \in \CY$.
#+BEAMER: \pause

**** Assumption: The data is generated i.i.d.
- $(x_t, y_t) \sim P$ for all $t$ (identical)
- $D \sim P^T$ (independent)
#+BEAMER: \pause
**** The optimal decision rule for $P$
\(\max_\pi U(\pi, P) =  \max_\pi \int_{\CX \times \CY} dP(x, y) \sum_a \pi(a | x) U(a,y).\)

Here we measure performance for the data *distribution $P$.*
#+BEAMER: \pause
**** The optimal decision rule for $D$
\(\max_\pi U(\pi, D)=  \max_\pi \sum_{(x,y) \in D} \sum_a \pi(a | x) U(a,y).\)

Performance is measured over the *data $D$*

*** Generalisation
**** The fundamental problem
- We want to maximise $U(\pi, P)$, the *actual* performance.
- We can only measure $U(\pi, D)$, over *some data*.
- We have a *learning algorithm $\lambda : \CD \to \Pols$*
- If $\pi = \lambda(D)$, then we instead measure $U(\lambda(D), D)$.
- However $\E_P[U(\lambda(D), D)] \geq U(\pi, P)$ $\forall \pi$ (*biased* estimator)
#+BEAMER: \pause
**** Training and testing
- Split $D$ in $D_{\textrm{train}}$, $D_{\textrm{test}}$
- Obtain $\pol = \lambda(D_{\textrm{train}})$
- Calculate $U(\pol, D_{\textrm{test}})$
- $\E_P[U(\pol, D_{\textrm{test}})] \alert{=} U(\pol, P)$ for any fixed $\pol$ (unbiased estimator)
- $\E_P[U(\lambda(D_{\textrm{train}}), D_{\textrm{train}})] \alert{\geq} U(\pi, P)$ (biased estimator)

* Estimating quality
** Methodology
*** The Train/Validation/Test methodology
**** Main idea
Use each piece of data once to make decisions and measure
**** Training set
Use to decide low-level model parameters
**** Validation set
Use to decide between:
- different hyperparameters  (e.g. $K$ in nearest neighbours)
- model (e.g. neural networks versus kNN)
**** Test set
Use to measure the final quality of a model


*** Cross-validation (XV)
**** Idea
- Use XV to select hyperparameters instead of a single train/valid test.
**** Methodology
- Split training set $D$ in $k$ different subsets
- At iteration $i$
- Use the \(i\)-th subset for validation
- Use all the remaining $k-1$ subsets for training
- Average results on validation sets

*** Cross-validation example: A mean estimate
Live coding in Python:
- Get a mean estimate
- Perform cross-validation
**** Hand-crafted 
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def xv_shuffler(x, estimator, scoring, n_folds):
	  rng = np.random.default_rng
	  # shuffle data
	  T = len(x)
	  indices = np.arange(T)
	  shuffle(indices)
	  fold_size = np.ceil(T / n_folds)
	  fold_start = np.zeros(n_folds)
	  fold_end = np.zeros(n_folds)
	  # create folds
	  for k in range(n_folds):
		  fold_start = k * fold_size
		  fold_end = np.min((k+1) * fold_size, T)
	  # for each fold:
	  # 1. Run estimator on k-1 folds

        
	  # 2. Score estimator on k-th set

#+END_SRC

**** sklearn built-in method
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(classifier, X, y, cv = n_folds)
#+END_SRC

*** Bootstrapping
- Express uncertainty by resampling the data.
- Repeat your calculations for each resample
#+BEAMER: \pause
**** BootstrapSample(D)
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE \textbf{input} Data $D = (z_1, \ldots, z_T)$, of size $T$
\FOR{$t \in \{1, \ldots, T\}$}
\STATE Select $i$ uniformly in $[T]$
\STATE Add the $i$-th point to $D_b$
\ENDFOR
\STATE \textbf{return} $D_b$
\end{algorithmic}
#+BEAMER: \pause
**** BootstrapEstimate($D, \lambda, N$)
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE \textbf{input} Data $D \in \mathcal{D}$, algorithm $\lambda : \mathcal{D} \to \Theta$, $N > 0$ number of samples
\FOR{$n \in \{1, \ldots, N\}$}
\STATE $\theta_n = \lambda(\textrm{BootstrapSample}(D))$
\ENDFOR
\STATE \textbf{return} $\{\theta_n : n \in [N]\}$
\end{algorithmic}



*** The wrong way to do XV for subset selection :activity:

1. Screen the predictors: find a subset of “good” predictors that show fairly strong (univariate) correlation with the class labels.
2. Using just this subset of predictors, build a multivariate classifier.
3. Use cross-validation to estimate the unknown tuning parameters and to estimate the prediction error of the final model.

**** Is this a correct application of cross-validation?
Consider a scenario with N = 50 samples in two equal-sized classes,
and p = 5000 quantitative predictors (standard Gaussian) that are
independent of the class labels.  The true (test) error rate of any
classifier is 50%.

*** The right way to do XV for feature selection :activity:
1. Divide the samples into K cross-validation folds (groups) at random.
2. For each fold $k = 1, 2, \ldots, K$
- Find a subset of “good” predictors that show fairly strong (univariate) correlation with the class labels, using all of the samples except those in fold k.
- Using just this subset of predictors, build a multivariate classifier, using all of the samples except those in fold k.
- Use the classifier to predict the class labels for the samples in fold k.

* Learning and generalisation
** Introduction
*** Learning and generalisation
How well can decision rule perform?

**** Estimation theory view
- Bias: The expected difference between the estimated value and the unknown parameter
- Variance: The expected difference between the estimated value and the unknown parameter
**** Learning theory view
- Approximation ability: How well a class of rules can approximate the optimal one.
- Statistical error: How easy it is to choose the best rule in the class.

** Bias and variance
*** Unbiased estimators
**** Estimator :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
An estimator is a function $f: \mathcal{D} \to \Theta$, where $\Theta$ is a set of parameters. For any given dataset $D \in \mathcal{D}$, it returns a single estimate $\hat{\theta} = f(D)$.

**** Unbiased estimator :B_definition:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: definition
     :END:
An estimator is *unbiased* if, for any $\theta$ and corresponding distribution $P(D | \theta)$:
\[
\E[f \mid \theta] = \sum_D f(D) P(D | \theta) = \theta.
\]
**** Sample mean estimator :B_example:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: example
     :END:
Consider $D = (x_1, \ldots, x_T)$ with $x_t \sim P$ being i.i.d samples with $\E[x_t] = \theta$.
The sample mean estimator $f(D) = \sum_{t} x_t / T$ is unbiased, as :
\[
\E[f] = \E\left[\sum_{t=1} x_t / T\right] = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1} \E[x_t] = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \theta = \theta.
\]

*** Example of a biased and unbiased estimator: Training error
- $U(\pi, D)$ is the measured accuracy of a classifier $\pi$ on $D$ 
- $U(\pi, P) = \E_{D \sim P} [U(\pi, D)]$ is the actual accuracy. So $U(\pi, D)$ is unbiased.
- $\lambda(D) = \argmax_\pi U(\pi, D)$ is a learning algorithm picking the best classifier for a dataset $D$.
- Then $U(\lambda(D), D)$ is biased, as for any $\pi'$
\begin{align}
\E_{D \sim P} [U(\lambda(D), D)]
 &= \int_{D} dP(D)  U(\lambda(D), D)\\
 &= \int_{D} dP(D) \max_\pi U(\pi, D)\\
 &\geq \int_{D} dP(D) U(\pi', D)\\
 &= U(\pi', P) 
\end{align}
i.e. the expected value of the training accuracy is higher than the accuracy of *any* classifier.

*** The bias/variance trade-off
- Dataset $D \sim P$.
- Predictor $f_D(x)$
- Target function $y = f(x) + \epsilon$
- $\E \epsilon = 0$ zero-mean noise with variance $\sigma^2 = \Var(\epsilon)$
**** MSE decomposition
\[
\E[(f - f_D)^2]= \Var(f_D) + \Bias(f_D)^2 + \sigma^2
\]
**** Variance
How sensitive the estimator is to the data
\[
\Var(f_D)
 = \E[(f_D - \E(f_D))^2]
% = \E(f_D)^2] + \E[f_D^2] - 2 \E[f_D \E(f_D)]
% = \E[f_D^2] - \E[f_D]^2
\]
**** Bias
What is the expected deviation from the true function
\[
\Bias(f_D) \defn \E[(f_D - f)]
\]
*** Example: mean estimation
- Data $D = y_1, \ldots, y_T$ with $\E[y_t] = \mu$.
- Goal: estimate $\mu$ with some estimator $f_D$ to minimise
- MSE: $\E[(y - f_D)^2]$, the expected square difference between new samples our guess.
**** Optimal estimate
To minimise the MSE, we use $f^* = \mu$. This gives us two ideas:
**** Empirical mean estimator:
- $f_D = \sum_{t=1}^T x_t / T$.
- $\Var(f_D) = \E [f_D - \mu] = 1/\sqrt{T}$
- $\Bias(f_D) = 0$. (unbiased estimator)
**** Laplace mean estimator:
- $f_D = \sum_{t=1}^T (\lambda + x_t) / T$.
- $\Var(f_D) = \E [f_D - \mu] = \frac{1}{1 + \sqrt{T}}$
- $\Bias(f_D) = O(1/T)$.

*** A proof of the bias/variance trade-off
- RV's $y_t \sim P$, $\E[y_t] = \mu$, $y_t = \mu + \epsilon_t$.
- Estimator $f_D$, $D = y_1, \ldots, y_{t-1}$.

&= \Var(f_D) + \Bias(f_D)^2 + \sigma^2
\end{align*}
#+END_EXPORT
** Generalisation
*** Generalisation error
**** Regret decomposition
Let the optimal rule be $\pol^* \in \Pols$, the best approximate rule be $\hat{\pi}^* \in \Pols$ and our rule be $\hat{\pol} \in \hat{\Pols}$. We call
the difference between the performance of $\pol^*$ and $\hat{\pol}$ our \alert{regret}:
\[
\underbrace{U(\pol^*, P) - U(\hat{\pol}, P)}_{\textrm{regret}} =
\underbrace{U(\pol^*, P) - U(\hat{\pol}^*, P)}_{\textrm{approximation error}} +
\underbrace{U(\hat{\pol}^*, P) - U(\hat{\pol}, P)}_{\textrm{estimation error}}
\]
We can bound the regret by bounding each term separately.
- The \alert{approximation error} tells us how expressive our class of rules is, i.e. how much we lose by looking at a restricted class $\hat{\Pi}$ of rules. It is similar to estimator \alert{bias}.
- The \alert{statistical error} tells us how well the empirical performance on $D$ approximates the true performance. It is similar to estimator \alert{variance}.
- As a rule of thumb, the larger our class, the better the possible approximation but the higher the statistical error.
*** Approximation error
- Our model limits us to a set of decision rules $\hat{\Pi} \subset \Pi$.
- The most we could do is find the best rule in $\hat{\Pi}$.
- This still leaves a gap:
\[
\Delta \defn  \max_{\pi \in \Pi} U(\pi, P) -  \max_{\hat{\pi} \in \hat{\Pi}} U(\pi, P)
\]
The gap can be characterised in some cases.
**** Example: \(\epsilon\)-net on Lipschitz $U(\cdot, P)$.
- Assume $U(\pi, P)$ is a Lipschitz function of $\pi$ for all $P$, i.e.
  $|U(\pi, P) - U(\pi', P)| \leq L d(\pi, \pi')$ for some metric $d$.
- Let $\hat{\Pi}$ be an \(\epsilon\)-net on $\Pi$, i.e.
  $\max_{\pi \in \Pi} \min_{\pi' \in \hat{\Pi}} d(\pi, \pi') = \epsilon$.
- Then $\Delta \leq L \epsilon$.
*** Estimation error

- First, let us bound $U(\hat{\pol}^*, P) - U(\hat{\pol}, P)$ by making an assumption.
- Then, we can prove that our assumption holds with high probability.

**** Lemma
Let $f, g : S \to \Reals$. If $\|f - g\|_\infty \leq \epsilon$ and $f(x) \geq f(z)$ , 
while $g(y) \geq g(z)$, for all $z$, i.e. $x,y$ maximise $f, g$ respectively
\[
f(x) - f(y) \leq 2 \epsilon.
\]
This holds as: $f(x) - f(y) \leq g(x) + \epsilon - f(y) \leq g(y) + \epsilon - f(y) \leq 2 \epsilon$.

**** Corollary
If $|U(\pol, P) - U(\pol, D)| \leq \epsilon$ for all $\pi$ then 
\[
U(\hat{\pol}^*, P) - U(\hat{\pol}, P) \leq 2\epsilon
\]

- Let us now prove that, with high probability, $|U(\pol, P) - U(\pol, D)| \leq \epsilon$.
*** Bounding the estimation error
  
For any fixed rule $\pol \in \Pols$ and utility function $U : \Pols \times \CX^T \to [0,1]$,
\[
P^T(|U(\pol, D) - U(\pol, P)| \geq \epsilon) \leq 2\exp(-2T\epsilon^2).
\]
This is a direct application of Hoeffding's inequality[fn:1].
Taking the union bound over the set $\hat{\Pols}$ gives:
\[
P^T(\exists \pol \in \hat{\Pols} : |U(\pol, D) - U(\pol, P)| \geq \epsilon) \leq 2 |\hat{\Pols}| \exp(-2T\epsilon^2).
\]
Setting the right side equal to $\delta$ and re-arranging,
\[
P^T \left(\max_{\pol \in \hat{\Pols}} |U(\pol, D) - U(\pol, P)|
 \geq \sqrt{\frac{\ln(2|\hat{\Pols}|/\delta)}{2T}}\right) \leq \delta.
\]
**** Example: \(\epsilon\)-net.
In a $n$ dimensional space we require $|\hat{\Pols}| = O(\epsilon^{-n})$. This means that our statistical error is $O(\sqrt{n \ln(1/\epsilon \delta)/T})$.

*** The finite hypothesis algorithm
- Input: a finite set of rules $\hat{\Pols}$, data $D$, utility $U$
- Return $\hat{\pol} \in \argmax_{\pol \in \hat{\Pols}} U(\pol, D)$.
**** Regret of the finite hypothesis algorithm.
With probability $1 - \delta$
\begin{align}
U(\hat{\pol}, P)
&\geq U(\hat{\pol}^*, P) -  \sqrt{2\ln(2|\hat{\Pols}|/\delta)/T}
\\
U(\pol^*, P) - U(\hat{\pol}, P) 
&\leq \Delta+  \sqrt{2\ln(2|\hat{\Pols}|/\delta)/T}
\end{align}
**** Examples
- ML estimation: $U(\param, D) = P_\param(D)$ is the data likelihood.
- Accuracy, etc: $U(\pol, D)$.
*** VC Dimension
Here we consider sets $\Pols$ of deterministic rules $\pol : \CX \to \{0, 1\}$.
**** Shattering
If a $S \subset \CX$ can with $|S|=m$, can be assigned any labelling $y_1, 
\ldots, y_m$ by a $\pol \in \Pols$, then we say $\Pols$ shatters $S$.

**** The VC dimension
This is the largest-size set $S$ that $\Pols$ can shatter.

**** Example: Perceptrons on $\Reals^2$
This class has VC dimension 3 on the plane.


* PAC Learning
** The realisable setting
*** Binary classification
**** Learning algorithm $\lambda$
- Takes data $D = \{(x_t, y_t)\}$ as input
- Generates deterministic decision rules $\pol : X \to \{0,1\}$,
**** The loss of a rule $\pol$.
- Assume an existing concept class $\pol^* \in \Pols$
- Distribution $x_t \sim P$ is i.i.d. and $x_1, \ldots, x_T \sim P^T$.
- The loss under distribution $P$ is
  \[
  L(\pol) = P(\{x : \pol(x) \neq \pol^*(x)\})
  \]
**** Realisable PAC learner
- $\lambda : (\CX \times \CY)^* \to \Pols$ is \((\epsilon, \delta)\)-PAC, if for any $P$ and  $\epsilon, \delta > 0$, and any concept $\pol^* \in \Pols$, there is $T$ such that
\[
P^T( \left\{ D : L[\lambda(D)] > \epsilon \right \}) < \delta,
\qquad
D = (\{x_t, \pol^*(x_t)\}), x_t \sim P.
\]
