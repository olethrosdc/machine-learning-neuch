    "\n",
    "To be more precise, we can interpret each meteorology as a model that predicts whether it will rain or not. Mathematically, this is expressed as $P(y | M_i)$ for each $i \\in M$, where $M$ is the set of possible meteorologist. Here, the random variable $y$ indicates whether it will rain or not (where $y = 1$ means rain and $y = 0$ means no rain). The output of each model, $P(y = 1 | M_i)$, represents the probability of rain for the next day.\n",
